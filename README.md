# V3SS3L

_A Decentralized Archive for Photography That Matters_

---

## 🧭 Project Mission & Strategy

**Mission**
V3SS3L exists to safeguard powerful images from across the globe — photographs that capture conflict, identity, culture, and transformation — using the permanence and transparency of blockchain technology.

**Strategy**
By leveraging Web3 infrastructure and community governance (DAO), V3SS3L enables photographers, curators, and collectors to submit, vote on, and preserve image-based stories that are at risk of erasure. Each selected photo — called a **Vessel** — becomes a tamper-proof capsule of memory, geotagged, storied, and stored permanently across decentralized networks.

## 🕰 Background & Purpose

In a time when images are lost to censorship, platform takedowns, broken links, or corrupt storage, V3SS3L offers an alternative: a permanent, ethical, decentralized visual archive.

This README outlines the core value proposition, platform architecture, user types, website structure, moderation strategy, and DAO governance for contributors, collaborators, and early supporters.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Decentralized media is essential in environments of repression and digital fragility.
- Photographs are historical records, but their meaning and context are easily lost without trusted infrastructure.
- Web3 enables community-led decision-making and anti-censorship publishing, but ethical curation is vital for trust and legal resilience.
